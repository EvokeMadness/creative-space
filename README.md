### EvokeMadness/creative-space is a collection of articles about engineering for makers and independent learners.

Each article is proofread for accuracy, and archived in several forms: digital, physical, cloud, and privately on GitHub. If a link does not work, please let me know by opening an issue, and I will try to find an alternative to the original source. In the case that an article becomes inaccessible, I will upload a digital copy; after examining the article's copyright and/or license. However, I encourage you to try to find the original source through the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) or [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

Happy making!
