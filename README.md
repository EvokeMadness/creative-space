# Awesome Engineering
Resources for makers, hobbyists, and independent learners.

This repository is a collection of articles I've referenced over the years while doing various DIY projects. Each article has been carefully chosen, proofread for accuracy, and archived for preservation purposes. I keep backups of these articles in several forms: digital, physical, cloud, and here on GitHub. If there are broken links to an article, please let me know by opening an issue, and I will try to find an alternative to the [original source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source). In the case that an article becomes completely inaccessible, I will upload a digital copy; after examining the article's license and/or copyright. However, I also encourage you to try to find the original source through the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) or [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

Happy making!
